When provide all the shopCode with JWT(accessToken),
there is the vulnerability with security.
Anyone can encrypt each user's JWT with console log,
if the shopCode and other things the hacker can use it in user's stored informations.

There is the alternative plan: using refresh Token.

Feature of refresh token: (compared with accessToken)
Longer lifespan like days or weeks.
Stored securely in . 
(-> Studying after storing JWT, ()
I determined to store refreshToken in different place with accessToken: 
Does not carry shopCodes/roles â€” just a unique identifier to validate in DB)
